# DSA
Practice of DSA 

This is my journey of learning Data Structure and Algorithm.
To write time and spacec efficent code , it is is very important to learn different type of Data structure and how to use them in code in most optimised way.
The curruent thought is to deep dive the different data structure first, get some hand on practice of those first . 
For that different notebook only dedicated to Data Structure will be there for examples
1. Array
2. Link List
3. Hash Table
etc.

and For then there will be notebooks for different algorithms and collections of different solutions in that.
All coding will be Python.
Very excited.
Let's begin.
